## The Beginning
Everything began on lovely Monday afternoon class. It was the first day of school and the teacher told us we would be hosting projects. It could have been anything, but it would benefit us more, if it would be in our own fields. 
After he had introduced us our job that we would be doing in 3 Months, everyone started rushing to find a pair or multiple pairs. Me, Virginia and Nikhil decided to go together for our projects. Mr Neil suddenly announced saying: “People who are in bigger groups will have an easier time displaying who’s doing what and that is why they’ll be graded much more strictly.” This was kind of alarming because we were one of the bigger groups, but we decided to stay together for the sake of our project.

## The Ideas
We got our idea with the help of our teacher, Mr. Neil. He was showing us previous projects done by the year before us and one of the ideas were programming a website. We really liked the idea, so we decided to go for it.

## Our Planning
Now we didn’t know what our website was going to be about, so we decided that we would all start collecting ideas, which was an event planner, a blog making site and a tourist guide to Zürich. At last, we decided to make a Zürich tourist guide website. We made a Assessment brief and we were ready to execute our project.

## Our Evaluation/ Decision 
After the planning, we decided to give every person a role. Virginia assured us on searching information of Zürich and Nikhil and I decided to do the programming for the site. Including programming the site, I took the role of doing the documentation, IPERKA, and as well the presentation.

## The Realisation
Everything was going smoothly till we had to show Mr Neil where we were at. I realised I wasn’t being a big contribute to the programming. Because Nikhil had experiences of programming a site, he didn’t need much of my offers to the programming and we decided to make a new plan. 
Instead of me programming, I will be designing the site and also doing my previous roles. We all agreed and proceeded on.


**If theres anything you, Virginia or Nikhil want to add in the realisation part which you did, add it in this section**
---> --->  V: I mainly focused on research and collecting the information we needed for our website for example the top 10 places to visit in Zurich. For that I looked the diferents places an drestaurant up on the internet and try to get as much information about it as possible and resume it. I also read reviews of people to each place (mainly restaurant and activities), so I would get a better idea of how people expierences were. I enjoyed the part of work I was aasigned to do beacuase I myself learnt a lot of interesting things about Zurich.

_Nikhil: what application I used, how it went, difficulties_

## The Control
We checked our mistakes..
---> Each time after adding something new to the code we would check how the website is working and if there is any problem. then we would try to improve the things that aren't right yet. 
We used a website called siteimprove.com to check how many and what type of errors we still had on our website.

**Nikhil:  how did u check for the mistakes**

## The Assessment
Our Group believes that we worked great together and accomplished the task we were assigned to do. We learned how to work together as a group and that it can be much more complicated and difficult than anticipated due to the fact that you have to trust every member with them 
fulfilling their assignment and in the given time. We had to learn to distribute the tasks strategically and have everyone work on something at the same time, plus to communicate consistently with eachother. Our website was programmed smoothly and we didnt have many problems. However, we did have problems with our GitHub of publishing articles, which was quite annoying.
All together we are very pleased with the outcome of our project, how well our group worked together and the fact that we completed everything on schedule as well as everything on our site.

**Goals??? ^^**
