## The Beginning
Everything began on a lovely Monday afternoon class. It was the first day of school and the teacher told us we would be hosting projects. It could have been anything, but it would benefit us more, if it would be in our own fields. 
After he had introduced us our assignments that we would be doing under 3 Months, everyone started rushing to find one or multiple pairs. Me, Virginia and Nikhil decided to go together for our projects. Suddenly Mr Neil announced saying: “People, who are in bigger groups will have an easier time displaying who’s doing what and that is why they’ll be graded much more strictly.” This was kind of alarming because we were one of the bigger groups, but we decided to stay together for the sake of our project.

<a name="theidea"></a>
## The Idea
We got our idea with the help of our teacher, Mr. Neil. He was showing us previous projects done by his previous studentts and one of the ideas was programming a website. We really liked the idea, so we decided to go for it.

Now we didn’t know what our website was going to be about, so we decided to do a brainstorming and we came up with these ideas, one of them was an *event planner*, a *blog making site* and a *tourist guide to Zürich*. At last, we decided to make a Zürich tourist guide website. 
The website would consists of a guide for tourists who want to visit Zurich or for people who live in Zurich and want to get to know their place better.
There will be several sections where you can explore sightseeings places you can visit, restaurants in Zurich and fun activities to do.
You can find a more detailed description of each of the mentioned topics above by clicking on them.

<a name="theplanning"></a>
## Our Planning
We made a [to-do list:](https://todoist.com/API/v9.0/import/project_from_url?t_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd1aspxi4rjqbaz.cloudfront.net%2F1e6dcf9bda9bd78f5e18da0de6edeca8_TBZ%2520Website%2520Project.csv) on https://todoist.com/. There we wrote our most important goals and procedure on it.</br></br>

### Our Process
```On Excel we made our our three month long process. The color describes who is who and who is doing what. On the left side are the assignments and on top are the days of our three month long journey.</br></br>```

### Smart goals:<a name="thegoals"></a>
```Here are the goals we decided for our website:```
- The website is structured properly in a way that it is easily use
- The website is compatible for all devices
- By the 5th of november, the website is online and available (for everyone)
- At least 5 people have visited our website within the next 2 months of its launch

 After that, we made our [Assessment brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTr6faLNu0i9bR0ShboSFeq028kOjQ7R/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101317544645534986868&rtpof=true&sd=true) and we were ready to execute our project.

## Our Evaluation/ Decision 
After the planning, we decided to give every person a role. Virginia assured us on searching information of Zürich and Nikhil and I decided to do the programming for the site. Including programming the site, I took the role of doing the documentation, IPERKA, and as well the presentation.

### Milestones:
1. Discussion of the the layout and design for the website
2. Gathering all the information about Zurich complete
3. Program the code for the website
4. Compare the Website to the design of the site
5. Upload the website to the internet

<a name="therealisation"></a>
## The Realisation
Everything went smoothly until we had to show Mr. Neil where we were. I realized that I had not contributed much to the programming. Since Nikhil already had experience coding a website, he no longer needed my help with programming, thus we decided to come up with a new plan. Instead of programming, I will design the site along with my previous tasks. We all agreed and went ahead with it.<br>
Designing the website was not easy, because most guide websites look very similar. I took a lot of inspiration from https://www.zuerich.com/de. I really enjoyed documenting due to me keening about writing. In addition, Virginia and I also filled in the assignments.</br>
Virginia was the researcher for our project. She gathered tons of information by contacting many websites. Searching for information is very difficult, especially when you have to make sure that the text is not identical, which Virginia did a great job of. She searched for the 10 best places to visit, the best restaurants in Zurich and also fun activities to do in Zurich. Through her research, she learned a lot of new information about Zurich. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, Virginia used many websites for her research, but she can't remember every site. Therefore, we have linked the sites she was certain of using and have linked them in [the ressources](#ther) section. </br>
Nikhil was the programmer of our website. He already had experience programming a website, so he didn't have much difficulty. He had learned a lot more about programming, and he enjoyed the experience. He used Visual Studio Code to program and used HTML, CSS, and Bootstraps to script our website. In the process, I showed him the design I had drawn for our website, and he followed through and designed the website to look like my agreed design. 
For the website to be fun, it has to have colors and pictures. Unfortunately, we can't take pictures from the internet because of the copyright. So we decided to make pictures for the sites ourselves. That was a lot of fun.

<a name="thecontrol"></a>
## The Control
We checked our mistakes by asking eachother and the people around us. 
In programming, every time Nikhil added something new to the code, we would check how the site would work. If there were any problems, we would try to improve the things that were not quite right yet. Virginia and I had to do the writing parts of our project. For that we constantly asked eachother for opinions of grammatical errors.<br>
We used a website called [siteimprove.com](https://www.siteimprove.com/) to check how many and what type of errors we still had on our website. To gather more opinions, we asked our friends what they thought about our website. My friends really liked how informative our site was, but they found it bland. After some improvements, they found it acceptable.

### Criteria 
```Here are our criteria for our website:```
- The users can access the website from different devices
- All pictures were taken by ourselves and are not from the Internet
- The website should not take longer than 2 seconds to load.
### Test Case
```The test case is what should happen, when you go on the website. Everything is listed of how everything should proceed.```

## The Assessment
Our Group believes that we worked great together and accomplished the task we were assigned to do. We learned how to work together as a group and that it can be much more complicated and difficult than anticipated due to the fact that you have to trust every member with them fulfilling their assignment and in the given time. We had to learn to distribute the tasks strategically and have everyone work on something at the same time, plus to communicate consistently with eachother.</br>
Our website was programmed smoothly and we didnt have many problems. However, we did have problems with our GitHub of publishing articles, which was quite annoying. We also have completed most of [our goals](#thegoals). Not all because one our goals indicates itself in the future </br>
```"At least 5 people have visited our website within the next 2 months of its launch"```. </br>
We are confident this goal is going to get fulfilled.
All together we are very pleased with the outcome of our project, how well our group worked together and the fact that we completed everything on schedule as well as everything on our site.
